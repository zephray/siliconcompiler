Revision History and Change Log
=================================

The changes in each SiliconCompiler release version are described below. Commit
version shown in (). Where applicable, the contributors that suggested a given
feature are shown in [].

SiliconCompiler 0.9.3 (2022-08-01)
=========================================

**Major:**

* Added basic editing functionality for signoff checklists in HTML report.
* Changed file collection behavior:

  * For local runs, inputs are not copied into import/ at all.
  * For remote runs, inputs are copied into import/0/inputs/ only, not outputs/.
* Implemented ['option', 'entrypoint'], allowing users to specify an alternative top-level.
* Implemented support for "pure Python" tools.

  * A ``run()`` method inside a tool setup file will be run instead of an executable.

**Minor:**

* Changed ``run()`` behavior to read metrics from all leaf tasks.
* Fixed implementation of ['option', 'jobincr'].
* Fixed bug causing exception on ``summary()`` for machines with a default encoding other than UTF-8.
* Fixed logfile reading logic to gracefully handle invalid characters.
* Improved error messages for some common issues.

SiliconCompiler 0.9.2 (2022-07-08)
=========================================

**Major:**

* Schema: Added ['option', 'flowcontinue'] to control whether flow continues when a tool reports errors.

  * This used to be controlled by ['tool', \<tool\>, 'continue'], but this parameter is meant to feed directly into tools (rather than controlling the SC runtime).
* Schema: Added ['option', 'continue'] parameter to control whether errors in the Python API are fatal.

  * The default value makes errors fatal, setting this parameter to True reverts to the old behavior.
* Added VPR-based FPGA bitstream generation flow.
* Added logic to set errors and warnings metrics based on ['tool', \<tool\>, 'regex', ...] matches. This reduces tool driver boilerplate and makes the metrics consistent with the generated regex match files.

**Minor:**

* Changed default technology target for ``sc`` app.
* Changed KLayout show script to always use a dark background.
* Changed ``check_manifest()`` to allow tool tasks to have multiple inputs (behaving as if they were merged with a "join" builtin).
* Changed ``check_manifest()`` to return True on success rather than 0 (the previous behavior didn't match the documentation).
* Changed Yosys and OpenROAD tool drivers to make them easier to use in flows with alternate step names.
* Changed GHDL tool driver to allow additional CLI options via ['tool', \<tool\>, 'var', ..., 'extraopts'].
* Removed return codes from ``post_process()``.

SiliconCompiler 0.9.1 (2022-06-21)
=========================================

**Major:**

* Added input filetype inference based on file extension (restores functionality lost in 0.9.0).
* Added manifest tree viewer to HTML report.
* Added simulator exe compilation support to Verilator.
* Improved TCL manifest generation:

  * Fixed escaping of special characters and whitespace.
  * Fixed insertion of "$env" in filepaths.
  * Changed tuple printing to be TCL list instead of tuple-like string.

**Minor:**

* Schema: Added tool CLI arguments to ['record', ...] schema.
* Changed create_cmdline() switchlist parameter to accept switch names as specified on command line.
* Changed setup module docs generator to be packaged with SC.
* Changed HTML report to be self-contained.
* Fixed CSV manifest generation.

SiliconCompiler 0.9.0 (2022-05-19)
=========================================

**Major:**

* Schema: Reorganized entire schema! Changes summarized below:

  * Cleaned and consolidated top-level organization, most parameters are now nested.
  * Moved build configuration options underneath ['option', ...].
  * Added ['output', ...] to store pointers to flow outputs.
  * Added ['model', ...] to store pointers to design abstractions (timing libraries, layouts, etc).
  * Added ['datasheet', ...] to store information about design's interface.
  * Added ['unit', ...]  to store user driven SI units specificaiton (temp,voltage, etc)
  * Renamed ['eda', ...] to ['tool', ...]
  * Renamed ['mcmm', ...] to ['constraint', ...]
  * Replaced ['source'], ['constraint'], and ['read', ...] with more flexible ['input', \<filetype\>] to supply input files.
  * Added support for storing multiple PDKs in schema and selecting which one to use for run (analagous to flows).
  * Change ['flowgraph'] to support modular flow composition
  * Added support for package management ['depgrah'].
  * Added checklist support.
  * Removed special ['library', ...] keypaths. All libraries are now created as Chip objects, and have their full config imported into a parent chip's schema.
* Added 'sup' packaging utility
* Added ability to configure stdout and stderr redirection on a per-tool basis (thanks to @suppamax for implementing).
* Added flexible tool version checking based on PEP-440 standard, now enabled by default.
* Added 'clean' feature for cleaning up intermediate tool outputs.
* Added 'resume' feature for restarting failed flows (for debugging).
* Added automatic capture of peak memory usage (adds dependency on `psutil <https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_).
* Changed ['design'] to be a required parameter for instantiating a Chip.
* Changed error behavior to consistently raise exceptions rather than exit.
* Removed tool script copy feature, so now all EDA scripts are run from the reference directory.

**Minor:**

* Schema: Added ability to store per-parameter designer notes.
* Added offline wheels distribution.
* Added ``read_lef()`` function to help with PDK bring-up.
* Added environment variables to replay scripts.
* Added LVS/DRC signoff flow and top-level GDS stream out flow.
* Added native support for Sky130 I/O library, along with Heartbeat + padring example.
* Changed internals to minimize SC performance overhead with large flowgraphs.
* Changed task runtime tracking to distinguish between time spent in tool and total time.
* Fixed breakpoints to work more consistently across tools.

Note: Since there was no public release of version 0.8.0, this list summarizes all changes since 0.7.0.
